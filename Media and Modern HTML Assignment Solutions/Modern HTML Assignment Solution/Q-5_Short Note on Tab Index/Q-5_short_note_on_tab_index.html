    <h1>Tab Index</h1>
    <h4>
        The tabindex, a global attribute which allows developers to make HTML elements focusable, allow or prevent them from being sequentially focusable usually with the <q>Tab</q> key and determine their relative ordering for sequential focus navigation.<br/>
        Basically, the <strong>tabindex</strong> attribute is primarily intended to allow tabbale elements to have a custom tab order(specified in positive numerical order), instead of just being tabbed through in their default source order.
        <br/><br/>
        It accepts an integer as a value, with different results depending on the integer's value and there are two additional options available for tabindex :
    </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>tabindex = &quot;0&quot;</strong> :- This option allows elements that are not usually able to be focused via the keyboard to become focusable. This value of tabindex is particularly beneficial.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li>
            <strong>tabindex = &quot;-1&quot;</strong> :- This option enables elements that are not typically focusable, to receive focus programmaticallly, such as through JavaScript, or as the target of links.
        </li>
    </ol>
