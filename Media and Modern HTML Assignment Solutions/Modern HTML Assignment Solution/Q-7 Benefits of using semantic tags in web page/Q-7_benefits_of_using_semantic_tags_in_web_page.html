    <h1>Benefits of using semantic tags in web page</h1>
    <p>
        Semantic tags are HTML tags that give <strong>meaning to the content</strong> of a web page beyond just its presentation. They provide information about the structure and the meaning of the content, making it easier for <strong>search engines</strong>,<strong>screen readers</strong> and other tools to understand the page and its content. Unlike traditional HTML tags, semantic tags focus on the meaning of the content, rather than on the visual appearance.

    <p>
        For example:- the <strong>&lt; header &gt;</strong> tag is a semantic tag indicating that the header section of a page begins, while the <strong>&lt; article &gt;</strong> tag indicates that the enclosed content is an <strong>independent piece of content</strong> that can stand alone and so on.
