    <title>Three ways to improve accessibility of HTML</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>List of 3 ways to accessibility of HTML</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Page layouts</h3>
            <p>
                Instead of using nested &lt; div &gt; elements to design a web page layout, it is preferable to utilise proper sectioning elements to encapsulate web page's<br/>main (&lt; main &gt;), navigation (&lt; nav &gt;), footer (&lt; footer &gt;), repeated content units (&lt; article &gt;), and other relevant content.<br/>
                These elements offer additional semantics to screen readers and other assistive tools, providing users with more context and information about the content they are browsing.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Keyboard accessibility</h3>
            <p>
                Keyboard accessibility is an important aspect of web accessibility that ensures users with mobility or visual impairments, or those who cannot use a mouse, are able to navigate and interact with web content using only a keyboard. We can use <strong>index</strong> and <strong>role</strong> attributes to increase keyboard accessibilty.

            <h3>Accessible Rich Internet Applications(ARIA)</h3>
            <p>
                The Accessible Rich Internet Applications(ARIA) comprises <strong>roles</strong> that establish methods for improving accessibilityof web content and web applications, for individuals with disabilities.
