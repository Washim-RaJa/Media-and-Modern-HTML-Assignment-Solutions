    <h1>HTML Entities</h1>
    <h3>
        The HTML Entites are strings of text that start with an ampersand symbol(&amp;) and end with a semicolon (;). These entities are commmonly used to demonstrate characters that are reserved (otherwise, they would be interpreted as HTML code) and imperceptible characters such as non-breaking spaces. Additionally, they can be substituted for other characters that are challenging to input using a conventional keyboard.
